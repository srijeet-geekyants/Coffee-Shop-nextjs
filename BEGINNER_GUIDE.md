**A:** No! Start with the Quick Start and learn as you go. The template works without understanding everything.

**A:** That's how you learn! Use git to go back to a working version, or re-clone the template.

### **Q: Should I use this for my first project?**

**A:** If you know React basics, yes! If you're brand new to React, start with `create-react-app` first.
